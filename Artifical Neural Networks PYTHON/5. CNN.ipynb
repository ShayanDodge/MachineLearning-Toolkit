    "  **Zero Padding:** A neuron positioned at row $i$, column $j$ within a specific layer receives inputs from neurons in the previous layer situated in rows $i$ to $i + f_h – 1$, and columns $j$ to $j + f_w – 1$. Here, $f$ represents the height and width of the receptive field. To maintain **consistency in layer dimensions** with the preceding layer, it's typical to append zeros around the inputs, as depicted in the diagram. This practice is commonly referred to as **zero padding**."
