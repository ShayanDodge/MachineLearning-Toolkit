    "We will train a model on set A (classification task with 8 classes), and try to reuse it to tackle set B (binary classification). We hope to transfer a little bit of knowledge from task A to task B, since classes in set A (sneakers, ankle boots, coats, t-shirts, etc.) are somewhat similar to classes in set B (sandals and shirts). However, since we are using `Dense` layers, only patterns that occur at the same location can be reused (in contrast, convolutional layers will transfer much better, since learned patterns can be detected anywhere on the image, as we will see in the CNN chapter)."
